# 4Players ODIN SDK

ODIN is a cross-platform software development kit (SDK) that enables developers to integrate real-time chat technology into multiplayer games, apps and websites.

## Important Notice

Please note that 4Players ODIN is currently in **Beta** and features are being added over time. We are currently accepting a limited amount of games into our [Early Bird](https://www.4players.io/odin-application/) program as we continue to improve the service and server capacity.
